Power curve simulation...

We want to look at type 1 and type 2 error.
H0 : the distribution is Normal with mean 0 and variance 1.
H1 : the distribution is Normal with mean k and variance 1.


We will generate 1000 samples from the distribution specified by H1. Each sample consists of 20 draws from Normal(k,1).
For each sample, we will compute its mean, resulting in a distribution of sample means (roughly normal with mean k, and variance 1/20).


To compute the power of the test at each significance level, alpha, we will loop through a range of values for alpha, compute how far away the mean of each sample i is from 0.
If we obtain a test statistics, z_i, that corresponds to a probability > alpha, we fail to reject H0.
If we obtain a test statistics that corresponds to a probability < alpha, we will reject H0.
